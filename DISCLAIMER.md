We evaluate the data provided by the John Hopkins University [link](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
We exclude any liability with regard to the quality and accuracy of the data used, and also with regard to the correctness of the statistical analysis. The evaluation of the different growth phases represents solely our personal opinion.

The number of cases reported may be significantly lower than the number of people actually infected. Also, we must point out that week-ends and changes in the test system may lead to fluctuations in reported cases that have no equivalent in actual case numbers.

Certainly, at this stage all statistical predictions are subject to great uncertainty because the general trends of the epidemic are not yet clear. In any case, the statistical trends that we interpret from the data are only suitable for predictions if the measures taken by the government and authorities to contain the pandemic remain in force and are being followed by the population. We must also point out that, even if the statistics indicate that the epidemic is under control, we may at any time see a resurgence of infection figures until the disease is eradicated worldwide.
