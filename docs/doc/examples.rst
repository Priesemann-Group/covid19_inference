.. automodule:: covid19_inference

We supply a number of examples which can be found in the `scripts <https://github.com/Priesemann-Group/covid19_inference/blob/master/scripts/example_one_bundesland.ipynb>`_ 
folder of the github repository.

These examples are given as python files and interactive ipython notebooks. The python files get automatically converted into ipython notebooks for easier use with google colab.
The conversion is done by a slightly modified version of the `python2jupyter module <https://github.com/remykarem/python2jupyter>`_, which can be found `here <https://github.com/pSpitzner/python2jupyter>`_.

For starters the most useful examples are the non hierarchical `one bundesland example <https://github.com/Priesemann-Group/covid19_inference/blob/master/scripts/interactive/example_one_bundesland.ipynb>`_ and the `hierarchical analysis of the bundeslaender <https://github.com/Priesemann-Group/covid19_inference/blob/master/scripts/interactive/example_bundeslaender.ipynb>`_.
